Everything was fascinating, people, plants, animals - the world around you was an endless source of knowledge and adventures. Years went by, and the older you grew, the better you realized - you weren't destined for a simple peasant's life. You mastered your father's trade well, but deep in your heart, you've always dreamed to become...#

The old man said that he'd been roaming the world searching for a youth to whom he could pass all of his great knowledge. And you were happy beyond belief when Danur chose you! The elder paid your parents more gold than they'd seen in their lives. You bade farewell to your family and fellow villagers and followed Danur towards your Destiny.#

Your tribe invaded some Forsaken God's temple, and while your fellow tribesmen were busy plundering and raping, you decided to take a crap on the altar, just for the fun of it. And the Forsaken God, having a weird sense of humor, responded with a joke of his own, depriving you of your body and memories and giving you the chance to find out how it feels when someone craps on your altar...#

He has virtually lost his self, becoming a tool in the hands of Death. And you cannot blame a knife for the murder it is used to commit.#

However, even then, Chaos was gathering its dark minions around the lands of the Forest Folk. When I entered the age of Knowledge, I went to the Sacred Groves to learn nature's wisdom from the druids. But my education was cut short when my father died in battle with the dark creatures at the Weeping Bogs. I inherited his crown and the responsibility for the fate of my people. The war against the spawn of Chaos went on and on for a very long time. Long even for the elves. Our ranks were getting thin, yet the armies of the Underworld were only multiplying.#

He put in a lot of effort by sending emissaries to destroy or distort information about him in Eador. That's why none of those wishing to repeat the ritual ever succeed. They all remain on the physical plane. A lich is immortal, like any other Astral Master. But it has a vulnerability - the phylactery containing his mortal soul. If this vessel is destroyed, L'Anshar will turn into a heap of ashes.#
Answer1: I don't think that finding the phylactery would be easier than besieging his castle.;#####

Text: #Believe me, it would be much easier. Such a phylactery can only be hidden in one place - the world of Death. Each Altar of Death is a portal to that world. However, the world of Death is rather large, and not every altar will take you to the phylactery you're searching for. You don't have to be too smart to realize that the altar you need is located on L'Anshar's world. So instead of trying to destroy the lich's castle, it would be much easier to search a few altars in his world. Certainly at least one of them will take you where you need to go.#

Text: #It's a little more complicated than that, boss. Goblin mechanisms run on entirely different principles than the machines of the Ancients. Goblin devices are pure mechanics and chemistry with a bit of magic. They are rather simple and crude. As for the Ancients, they used the energy of the Astral as the driving force for their mechanisms. They used special transformers to convert Astral power into a form usable by machines. The machines themselves are fine masterpieces of technical art. The tiniest part from one of the Ancients' machine is more complicated and elaborate than the most ingenious dwarven or goblin mechanism.

Text: #After the successful coup Herskil, as the main instigator of the riot, usurped power in the country, thus upsetting the local nobility, who had supported the riot simply because they had their own plans for the throne. However, the former mercenary proved to be a sly politician. With generous use of his purse, he gained the support of the church of the Lord of Light. Such a powerful ally was Herskil's safeguard from the displeased nobility, showing people some "divine miracles". Soon the priests declared Herskil to be the Anointed of the Lord of Light and the only legitimate ruler.#

Dementia and hemorrhoids had gotten the best of him, so the poor thing decided to say goodbye to his mortal body and move to the Astral, where the soul is freed from the sufferings of the flesh. Along the way, the old geezer, imagining himself the Great Savior of All Dragons, decided to create a world where his fellow dragons could live a good life. The other dragons don't give a damn about Dorikos and his world. However, dragons are famous for their asinine stubbornness, and Dorikos is no exception - he won't give up on his idea.#

They didn't give a damn about the fate of the world. They were interested in the process, not the result.

By creating humans, a perfect race of worshipers, Raenu provided himself with a constant flow of energy from their prayers. So now, it is the prayers of the mortals that light our world. Literally.

It is his life that transforms the prayers of mortals into sunshine. Of course, people often give up faith in the Lord of the Light and elect another subject to worship, and unlike the Alkari, a birdeater would fit that role. They need a leader and a god, leading them in battle and inspire them, and Raenu... I think the only feeling he has now is pain.#

On the physical plane, anyone trying to get to Raenu would be fried by his rays. You probably want to know how he occasionally manages to answer the prayers of mortals, and to perform miracles? I suspect that this is the work of the Seraphim. After the sacrifice of Raenu some of them went down to the physical plane, and others remained in the Astral.
