76. Lord of Phantoms

87. Centaur Tribe
#With a large tribe of centaurs security is very, very high. Few are able to overcome such a strong army. Centaurs are honest and proud beings and will only accept provisions as payment.

All the warriors of the Children of Heaven are faithful to their people and unable to deliberately betray them.
The province spotting range is increased.
Incorruptible.#

93. Combat Wing

96. Plaguebringers
#From time to time, Ratmen led by Plague Masters form small packs, and begin to prepare for a "plague campaign", spreading various diseases among the population, usually accompanied by looting.
