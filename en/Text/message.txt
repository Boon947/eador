24. Resources
#%s

This resource is one of the so-called strategic resources. If you want to construct a building or hire a unit that requires a certain strategic resource you don't possess, you will have to pay the market price of this resource in gold and gems (if the production requires several pieces of the resource, you have to pay for each unit). After each purchase of the resource, its starting price increases a little. Keep in mind that starting price of every resource is the same for all players.
Strategic resources cannot be accumulated. If you have at least one province that produces a certain strategic resource, you won't have to pay its price anymore. In order for the province to produce an available resource, the deposit has to be on an explored territory, unguarded by neutral parties.
In addition, you can gain access to some resources via trading with other players.#

30. Explored
#The percentage of explored land shows how much of the province has been charted. The explored lands can be used for settlement and farming. When there is not enough explored land, the exploration percentage is displayed in red. A hero can be tasked with an order to explore the province. During exploration, heroes often find unusual things.#

31. Mood
#The population's mood determines their working capacity and growth rate. If the population is unhappy, unrest starts to accumulate in the province (red bar). When unrest reaches its limit, a rebellion will begin. If the population is calm and content, the accumulated unrest will slowly dissipate.#

32. Province level
#The province population size determines the income it generates to a large extent. The green bar shows the population above the current level. When the green bar reaches the end, the province will achieve a new level. Dead lands have no population, the green bar shows how soon these lands will become habitable again. For cursed lands, the bar shows the duration of the curse - after the curse expires, they turn into a dead land.#

33. Province type
#There are various neutral provinces in the game. Province type determines its population, exploration percentage, and potential guards. In addition, certain types of provinces may contain special secret locations.#

#Either there are no strategic resources in this province, or they are located on unexplored territory.#

44. Plains
#The plains are typically the fertile lands that yield plentiful harvests. Gold income from the plains provinces is very high. People eagerly settle in the plains, so the population grows quite quickly. Plains provinces are open terrain, exploring them doesn't take much time. Low gem income is the main disadvantage of plains.

48. Mountains
#Mountains are an impassable terrain. Heroes cannot pass through the mountainous regions.#

49. Seas

76. Campaign, failed to defend the world
#Another Master destroyed your world, and demons dragged you into Chaos. The last thing you remembered was a raging blaze devouring your very essence.#

77. Campaign, surrendered
#Under the new Overlord of Eador an uneasy truce was established between the Masters. Your small world was accepted into the New Eador pleiad of worlds. The long years of preparation for the final battle against Chaos are waiting ahead. It seems Eador finally has an elusive chance of winning this battle...#

78. Campaign, Ul-Dagan
#Ul-Dagan destroyed Eador, wishing to become the sole demiurge of the new Creation. Perhaps, he will succeed in creating a new world, but you will never see it...#

79. Campaign, Beleth's servant
#Having a vast world at his disposal, Beleth defeated the other Masters easily. Those who refused to submit to his power were mercilessly destroyed. Having become Eador's sole Overlord, Beleth established a cruel dictatorship, assuming the title of the One God and banning other religions. Due to the strict order established by Beleth's iron fist, Chaos receded from the orderly world.
Beleth appointed you as his first councilor, granting you a large estate in the heart of New Eador. You entered the time of prosperity. However, something was troubling your heart - with every passing day the Sun gave less and less light and heat...#

80. Campaign, demolition by the Destroyer
#With the help of The Destroyer, all the worlds of other Masters were demolished. The order in Eador weakened, and a dark wave of Chaos spawn surged out of the Underworld. Your only hope is to try and fight back the hordes of Chaos with the power of The Destroyer. Little if anything will remain of Eador...#

81. Campaign, surrender to the Destroyer
#You became the Overlord of Eador. However, the conquered Masters never found peace among themselves. Many continued fighting and plotting against each other. Each of the enslaved secretly wished to overthrow you and take your place. However, the greatest danger remains that if anything ever happens to the Destroyer, a foundation of your rule, then your reign and likely your life as well would soon be over.#

82. Campaign Keys of Truth
#Your contribution to Eador's Fate is truly great. Even if the «Return of the Creator» can't save the ordered world, you brought hope to all creatures of Eador, mortals and immortals alike.
The newly-formed Masters' Council offered you the honorary title of the Keeper of Truth and the right to settle disputes between other Masters.#

83. Campaign, Enemy destroyed
#All your enemies were cast down into Chaos. The title of the Overlord of Eador is rightfully yours. Now, with no competition to worry about, you can focus on uniting all shards into one world that would be able to fight back the forces of Chaos. Mortals call you the Creator God and the Protector God. Immortals know you as the Conqueror. 
Eador's future lies in your hands.#

84. Campaign, destroyed all flesh
#After the death of all living things, the Sun slowly faded. Gradually it turned into a lifeless black sphere that was engulfed by Chaos. 
Eador became a dead gray wasteland surrounded by the ocean of Chaos on all sides. The time in the dead world flowed slowly and seemed endless. You had nothing to do, nothing to yearn for. Eventually your heart started hoping for the moment when Chaos would finally engulf Eador's remains. Perhaps, that will happen one day...#

85. Campaign, assembled the Talisman
#With your help Erdu was able to assemble the talisman that protects Eador against Chaos. You destroyed a multitude of dark creatures that sneaked into the orderly world. An uneasy truce was established between the Masters. At last, there is hope that Eador won't be destroyed. Chaos has no power over the orderly world as long as the Talisman is intact.
Mortals exalt you as the great combatant against Chaos. Word of your glorious deeds goes before you throughout Eador. You have every right to be proud of your accomplishments.#

86. Campaign, demonic invasion
#The orderly world was destroyed by the spawn of Chaos. You were among the Masters who saw the final day of Eador. Unfortunately, you were unable to prevent the world's collapse. Perhaps, one day another orderly world will emerge, and by fate you will be among its inhabitants again...#

88. Campaign, memory 1
#The shards of your world scattered across Eador. Their inhabitants, absorbed in their everyday business, soon forgot about you. Most likely, no one in the future will ever remember that once upon a time there was a Master named %s.#

89. Campaign, memory 2
#The shards of your world scattered across Eador, and most of their inhabitants soon forgot about you. Only a few mortals from among your former heroes made a lonely pilgrimage from town to town, trying to remind people that it was you who once saved these lands from Chaos by joining them to your world. However, few listened to those heroes, and when they died, all memory of you disappeared from Eador. Most likely, no one in the future will ever remember that once upon a time there was a Master named %s.#

90. Campaign, memory 3
#The shards of your world scattered across Eador, but a few mortals never forgot their former Master. A secret cult formed on some of the shards.

The Holy Inquisition had a large say in that, furiously persecuting your worshipers. Soon the memory of you disappeared from Eador. Only a few manuscripts of a forgotten cult that managed to escape the Inquisition's bonfires preserve the knowledge that once upon a time there was a Master named %s.#

91. Campaign, memory 4
#The shards of your world scattered across Eador, but the mortals cherished the memory of their Master. Chapels in your name were built in several major cities. There mortals prayed and called unto you for help. However, their prayers remained unanswered, and, over the years, you were forgotten. The books written about your deeds gathered dust on library shelves. They interested no one except some historians who studied ancient gods and religions.
