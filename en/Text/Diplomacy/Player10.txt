Text: #My compliments to thee, oh %s! Of Iltan race, the only left I am - «The Ancients,» the young folk calls us now. Eons ago, as Erdu was I named. Indeed, this Shard will face a troubled time, as awful battles shake it to the ground, and yet some hope remains that not for naught these wars are fought and blood is spill'd in streams, and Eador its former strength restores, when struggle long and bloody comes to end. A strength the flames of war could forge alone.#
